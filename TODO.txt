- Review segment length delta (relative to wavelenght)

The main electrical consideration is segment length Delta relative to the
wavelength Lambda. Generally, Delta should be less than about 0.l Lambda at
the desired frequency. Somewhat longer segments may be acceptable on long
wires with no abrupt changes while shorter segments, 0.05 Lambda or less,
may be needed in modeling critical regions of an antenna. The size of the
segments determines the resolution in solving for the current on the model
since the current is computed at the center of each segment. Extremely short
segments, less than about 10-3 Lambda, should also be avoided since the
similarity of the constant and cosine components of the current expansion
leads to numerical inaccuracy.
[...]
The current expansion used in NEC enforces conditions on the current and
charge density along wires, at junctions, and at wire ends. For these
conditions to be applied properly, segments that are electrically connected
must have coincident end points. If segments intersect other than at their
ends, the NEC code will not allow current to flow from one segment to the
other. Segments will be treated as connected if the separation of their ends
is less than about 10-3 times the length of the shortest segment. When
possible, however, identical coordinates should be used for connected
segment ends.
